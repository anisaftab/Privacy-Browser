# Privacy-Browser
Description:
Privacy-Browser is a web browser made on PyQt5.
Privacy-Browser is a oriented to create a more safe and secure browsing experience for the user.
How?
The browser automatically deletes your history and cookies once you exit the browser.
So whenever you re-open the browser the websites you would have visited won't have accesss to old cookies.
There are many applications to such a browser, one such would be searching for flights.
The browser will help you in searching the perfect deal, you can keep on looking for flights using the browser without
having to worry about the webistes looking up your data.
To make it easier for Flight searching, I have added a Search Flights button, just go to Menu -> Search Flights.
This will open up most of the popular flight search websites for you to make your flight hunt easy.

How to use the browser:
Just download all the files in a folder and then click on the Browser icon to open a window.
OR
If you have git installed on your computer, just run the following command in a new folder:
git clone https://github.com/Anisaftab/Privacy-Browser.git

Happy Searching!!
